You are working in a Godot 4.5+ example project that MUST use `godot-game-framework` (GGF) as much as possible.

## Non-negotiables
- Prefer calling into **GGF managers** instead of creating new global singletons or bespoke manager nodes.
  - Prefer the **GGF manager accessors** when they exist:
    - `GGF.state()`, `GGF.ui()`, `GGF.network()`, `GGF.scene()`, `GGF.settings()`, `GGF.audio()`, `GGF.time()`, `GGF.input()`, `GGF.save()`, `GGF.pool()`, `GGF.resources()`
    - `GGF.events()`, `GGF.notifications()`, `GGF.log()`
  - If no accessor exists (e.g. project-specific manager), use `GGF.get_manager(&"MyManager")` (avoid hardcoding `/root/...` paths).
- Do NOT modify framework code in `addons/godot_game_framework/` unless the change is clearly reusable across projects.
  - First try to extend/override via project code (e.g. `src/managers/*`, `ggf/GGF.gd`).
- Keep the example “framework-first”:
  - **Flow** is driven by `StateManager` states (example uses `MENU`, `LOADING` as lobby, `PLAYING`).
  - **UI** is registered and controlled via `UIManager` (access via `GGF.ui()`).
  - **Networking** uses `NetworkManager` (access via `GGF.network()`) and reacts through `EventManager` events/signals.
  - Use `NotificationManager` for player-visible feedback.

## When to expand the framework (suggestions you should surface)
If implementing any of the below in the example, suggest promoting it into GGF (new manager or extension point) instead of local one-offs:
- **Lobby replication**: player names/ready state/lobby metadata synced server→clients.
- **Player registry/spawn orchestration**: standardized spawn points, late-join sync, despawn rules.
- **Authoritative validation**: server-side movement/interaction validation, anti-cheat hooks.
- **Session orchestration**: standardized “start match / end match / return to lobby” lifecycle helpers.
- **Matchmaking / NAT traversal**: beyond raw ENet host/join.
- **Networked scene management**: consistent server-authoritative scene loading & handshakes (integrating with `SceneManager`).

## Style / tooling expectations
- Use `./ggfe format` and `./ggfe lint` (CI enforces `./ggfe format --check --diff` and `./ggfe lint`).
- Keep GDScript type hints where reasonable; prefer clarity over cleverness.
